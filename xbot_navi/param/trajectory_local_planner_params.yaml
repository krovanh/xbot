  # Warning!
  #   do not set min_trans_vel to 0.0 otherwise dwa will always think translational velocities
  #   are non-negligible and small in place rotational velocities will be created.

  max_vel_theta: 0.5  # choose slightly less than the base's capability
  min_vel_theta: -0.5  # this is the min angular velocity when there is negligible translational velocity


  acc_lim_x: 0.3 # maximum is theoretically 2.0, but we
  acc_lim_theta: 1.0
  acc_lim_y: 0.0      # diff drive robot
